This folder contains our paper's setting files for DES elevated Surface Tension calculation

To use them;

Please install our package first, which can be download at https://github.com/orlandoacevedo/mLJR

Then command `mljr` will be ready to use.



# Setup

For example, we have some molecules;

![mljr-samples](mljr-samples.jpg)


## First, generate template setting file

```
mljr -t             # (purity)

OR

mljr -t --CCG       # (binary mixture)
```

In scripts, two types of templates are provided.


## Second, make setting file

With the understanding of above image, selectively make combinations & groups of your molecule.

To see available groups (structure segments), please use command;

```
mljr -g
```

## Last, run

```
mljr -f YOUR-SETTING-FILE       # show results on screen

OR 

mljr -f YOUR-SETTING-FILE -o    # append results to your file
```



# Testing on this folder

Also, here provides some samples, to test them;

```
mljr -f ONE-OF-SETTING-FILES-INSIDE-THIS-FOLDER
```
